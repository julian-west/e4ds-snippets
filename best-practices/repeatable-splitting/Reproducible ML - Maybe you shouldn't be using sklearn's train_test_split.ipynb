    "Reproducibility is critical for robust data science -- after all, it is a science.\n",
    "\n",
    "But reproducibility in ML can be surprisingly difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The behaviour of your model doesn't only depend on your code, but also the underlying dataset that was used to train it**\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, you need to keep tight control on which datapoints were used to train and test your model to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental tenet of the ML workflow is splitting your data into training and testing sets. This involves deliberately withholding some datapoints from the model training in order to evaluate the performance of your model on 'unseen' data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is vitally important to be able to reproducibly split your data across different training runs. For a few main reasons:\n",
    "- So you can use the same test datapoints to effectively compare the performance of different model candidates\n",
    "- To control as many variables as possible to help troubleshoot performance issues\n",
    "- To ensure that you, or your colleagues, can reproduce your model exactly\n",
    "\n",
    "**How you split your data can have a big effect on the perceived model performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you split your data 'randomly' there is a statistical chance that more outliers end up in the test set than the training set. As your model won't see many outliers during training, it will perform poorly on the test set when predicting 'outlier' values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine you randomly split the data again and the outliers now all reside in the training set and none in the test set. It is likely that your 'model performance' will increase. This performance increase has nothing to do with the model, just the statistical properties of the training/test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to control and understand the training and test splits when comparing different model candidates and across multiple training runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sklearn train_test_split**\n",
    " \n",
    "Probably, the most common way to split your dataset is to use Sklearn's [train_test_split](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the box, the `train_test_split` function will randomly split your data into a training set and a test set. Each time you run the function you will get a different split for your data. Not ideal for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ah!\" you say. \"I set the random seed so it is reproducible!\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Fair point. Setting random seeds is certainly an excellent idea and goes a long way to improve reproducibility. I would highly recommend setting random seeds for any functions which have non-deterministic outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**However, random seeds might not be enough to ensure reproducibility** \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post I will demonstrate that the `train_test_split` function is more sensitive than you might think, and explain why using a random seed does not always guarantee reproducibility, particularly if you need to retrain your model in the future."

    "\n",
    "The `train_test_split` is not *deterministic*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The splits from `train_test_split` are sensitive to any new data added to the dataset as well as the *ordering* of the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your dataset is shuffled or amended in any way, the data will be split completely differently. It cannot be guaranteed that the an individual datapoint will *always* be in the training set or *always* be in the test set. This means datapoints that were in the original training set might now end up in the test set and visa versa if the data was shuffled. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, for the same dataset, you can get different splits depending on how the rows in the dataset are ordered.** \n",
    "\n",
    "It is not a very robust solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if one datapoint is removed, the order of two rows are switched, or a single datapoint is added you will get a *completely* different training and test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "This 'ultra sensitivity' to the data might be surprising and lead to unexpected model training results which can be hard to debug and reproduce if your dataset ordering changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's demonstrate the issue with a simple demo.\n",

    "We will first download an example dataset from `skelearn.datasets` and create an 'index' column to uniquely identify each row."

    "\n",
    "### What is hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values\" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different hashing algorithms, but essentially they allow you to reproducibly convert an input into an arbitrary value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the hashing function is deterministic -- it will always be the same for the same input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work for splitting data reproducibly?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of data splitting, we can use hashing to reliably assign splits to individual datapoints. As this is a deterministic process, we can ensure that the datapoint is always assigned to the same split which aids reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process works as follows:\n",
    "- Use a unique identifier for the datapoint (e.g. an ID or by concatinating multiple columns) and use a hashing algorithm to convert it to an arbitrary integer. Each unique datapoint will have a unique output from the hashing function.\n",
    "- Use a [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) to arbitrarily split the data into 'buckets'\n",
    "- Select all datapoints in a subset of buckets to be the training set and the rest to be in the test set\n",

    "```\n",
    "# pseudo code\n",

    "else:\n",

    "### Reasons to use hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deterministic**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is robust to underlying changes in the data, unlike `train_test_split`.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Platform cross-compatibility quirks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that hashing is consistent across platforms. That is true to an extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "While researching for this article, I tested to see if the dataset splits from my Python program were identical to a dataset stored in [BigQuery using SQL instead](https://towardsdatascience.com/ml-design-pattern-5-repeatable-sampling-c0ccb2889f39).\n",
    "\n",
    "To my surprise, I found some edge cases where the results differed.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a lot of head scratching, I came across a two quirks of BigQuery which were causing the issue:\n",
    "1. [BigQuery does not support unsigned integers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51892989/how-does-bigquerys-farm-fingerprint-represent-a-64-bit-unsigned-int)\n",
    "2. BigQuery, [C and C++ have different implementations for the modulus operation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3883004/the-modulo-operation-on-negative-numbers-in-python) compared to Python when it comes to negative numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The `farmhash.fingerprint64` method returns an *[unsigned](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/247873/signed-versus-unsigned-integers)* integer. Whereas the BigQuery `FARM_FINGERPRINT` function returns an `INT64` datatype. Therefore, BigQuery converts the farmhash output to a *signed* integer. The value of signed integer might be different to the original unsigned integer value and it might be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, can't we just convert our Python farmhash value to a signed integer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, this leads to the second problem. In order to split the data into different buckets, we used the modulus operation. [Python and C (and BigQuery) have different implementations of the modulus operator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1907565/c-and-python-different-behaviour-of-the-modulo-operation#:~:text=Both%20variants%20are%20correct%2C%20however,same%20result%20as%20in%20Python.) which affects the results for negative numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if our signed integer is negative, the bucket it is assigned will differ depending on if we calculated it using Python's modulus operator (`%`) or BigQuery's `MOD` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# in python\n",
    "-1%10 = 9\n",
    "\n",
    "# in BigQuery\n",
    "MOD(-1,10) = -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this mean hashing is not platform independent? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, not really, just that you need to check how unsigned integers are treated and the how modulus of negative numbers is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can fix our Python implementation to protect against these issues by converting the unsigned output of farmhash to a signed int and using a custom 'C-like' implementation of the modulus function.\n",

    "### Alternatives to hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "For completeness, here are two other common and more explicit approaches for ensuring consistent train/test splitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Create an additional column in your data**\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use `train_test_split` (or another random splitting method) to initially define the splits. Then create an additional column in your dataset to explicitly record whether the datapoint should be included for training or test (or specify the fold for K-Fold validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an [example implementation by Abhishek Thakur](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/mlframework/blob/master/src/create_folds.py) who uses it to define the 'folds' for cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will ensure your splits are 'remembered' between training runs as they are explicitly defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the positive side, it is very transparent which datapoints belong to each split. However, a downside is that it increases the total size of your dataset which may not be sustainable for very large datasets. Additionally, if you do not have full control of the dataset (e.g. shared database table) you may not be able to add columns to the original schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Save your training and test data to different files**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common approach is to store your training data and test data to individual files after splitting the data for the first time. For example, into files called `train.csv` and `test.csv`. If the data is too large for individual files you could also save multiple files into folders named `train` and `test` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be a valid approach. However, sometimes it may not be feasible to make a copy of all your data and save into individual files. For example if the dataset size is very large or you don't have the permissions to make a copy from the original source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hashing approach can compute the deterministic data splits reproducibly on the fly and in-memory, preventing the need to copy data into individual files."
