    "\n",
    "String formatting (also known as string interpolation) is the process of inserting a custom string or variable into a predefined 'template' string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are four methods for formatting strings (also known as string interpolation):\n",
    "- % operator\n",
    "- str.format()\n",
    "- f-strings\n",
    "- Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact there are four different ways to format strings is a little confusing given that Python's own manifesto - the Zen of Python - states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) - \"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So if there should be one obvious way to format strings, why are there four native methods for formatting strings in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods has their own trade-offs and benefits when it comes to simplicity, flexibility, and/or extensibility. But what are the differences, which one should you use for which purpose and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of data science there are two common use cases for formatting strings:\n",
    "1. Print statements\n",
    "2. SQL queries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we will go through each of these use cases and describe which string formatting method might be most appropriate for your situation."

    "There are many different ways to format strings in Python. In data science you are most likely going to be requiring string interpolation for creating descriptive print statements or building dynamic SQL queries. Which string formatting method you use will depend on your use case, however, my rule of thumb is:\n",

    "- Use f-strings as the first choice for print statements\n",
    "- Resort to `str.format()` if dealing with dictionaries as inputs (useful for building simple SQL queries)\n",
    "- Use Jinja templating for reproducible and generalisable SQL queries\n",
