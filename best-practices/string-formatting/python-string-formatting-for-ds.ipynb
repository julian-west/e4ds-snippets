    "String formatting (also known as string interpolation) is the process of inserting a custom string or variable into a predefined 'template' string.\n",

    "In Python, there are four methods for formatting strings (also known as string interpolation):\n",

    "\n",
    "Each has their own trade-offs and benefits of simplicity, flexibility, and/or extensibility. But what are the differences, which one should you use for which purpose and why?\n",

    "1. Print statements\n",
    "2. User inputs\n",
